### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project I learned how to optimize my CSS a little better compared to my first challenge, the results-summary-component, I was also
able to implement media queries better. Overall this project has reinforced and refreshed my learnings from The-Odin-Project as well as the previous challenge. Lastly, I used semantics in my HTML in this project instead of using just <divs>, albeit I am still not proficient with them.

### Continued development

-Media Queries.
-Flexbox.
-Possibly using Grid in the next few projects.
-HTML Semantics usage.
