## My process
  Since the project is simple, I tried going for a mobile-first workflow. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project I learned to use basic CSS variables, I also tried the mobile-first workflow and it seems that is easier for me to approach similar projects in this manner as well. 


### Continued development
