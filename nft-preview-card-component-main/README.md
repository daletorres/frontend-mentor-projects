## My process
 In this challenge, I tried using CSS variables and better HTML semantics compared to my previous challenges. I encountered an issue with the hover state over the image because the SVG icon was being affected by the opacity I set with the background which I later resolved by adding z-index.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to add style to hover state with images albeit the approach I took may have been more complicated than it should be.

### Continued development

-CSS Variables
-HTML Semantics
-Hover states
